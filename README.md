#This is day 18 of my crypto infra backend journey. 
I'm extremely exhausted and in a sleep deficit after writing this, but this is a compiltion of a mix of projects,
from std::cout << "Hello World!" on Day 1 to a bunch of quote processors, each with their own a-factors. They are currently
semi-functional, and the quote processor from the 13th of April is currently my best version up to the time of 
writing (13th April 2025). But Now I will get some rest, because I coded all night after working from 3-11pm
as a full-time receptionist, whilst also doing my full-time bachelors degree (I'm in my final year- wish me luck!!!)
To whoever reads this, thanks, and see you soon!
